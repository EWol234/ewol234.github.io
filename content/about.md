Acting! Traveling! Education! Software Engineering! Do any of these words spark your interest?

Welcome to my blog! I am Tian. I create content to celebrate our collective journey as lifelong students and pioneers of our own future. I encourage my viewers to take their lives into their own hands, insofar as possible within their circumstances. You will find my advice for a career in acting, software engineering, and everything in between as we build and redirect our careers together. Look forward to travel tips! and REVIEWS!

I have degrees in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Theater Arts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a First Generation Low-Income student, I am money-conscious in my recommendations. My lived experiences of studying and working internationally make up most of my travel content. I use my knowledge from building a career in acting and STEM to guide viewers who are interested in building their own unconventional path.
